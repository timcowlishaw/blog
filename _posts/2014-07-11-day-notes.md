# Remedial mathematics

I got my results from some Open University maths and statistics exams this morning, and while I didn't fail anything, there were definitely areas in which I need to improve. Therefore I had a think about what the most important gaps in my mathematical ability are, and how to set about improving them. I suspected that my big weakness in my last year of OU study was real analysis, and my exam results confirmed this, so I'm going to revisit that. In addition, a lot of the material I struggle with in reading around the statistics and machine learning literature has to do with vector calculus, measure theory and functional analysis, so I'm going to have a look into those too.

Googling for some resources, I found sets of video lectures in [real analysis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL0E754696F72137EC), [functional analysis](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL554B877A872B4F94), and a [primer in probability theory](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL17567A1A3F5DB5E4) with a decent introduction to measure theory at the start. There's also an upcoming [Coursera course](https://www.coursera.org/course/functionalanalysis) in functional analysis. I watched through the measure theory videos from the probability primer series which were really useful, both as an introduction to measure theory, and a refresher in a few topics from analysis. It also gave useful pointers to some other resources, in particular a classic undergraduate real analysis textbook which, according to a commenter on its [Goodreads page](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/292079.Principles_of_Mathematical_Analysis?from_search=true) is the source text for the video lectures I'd already found, as well as a [really interesting searchable interface](http://rudinium.herokuapp.com/#/help) to both the text, lectures and some exercises, which looks worth exploring.

# Data visualisations and colour blindness

I'm doing some data visualisation work for a client at the moment, and [this tweet](https://twitter.com/gaufre/status/487316989799452672) reminded me that I really have to keep accessibility for colourblind people in mind. Looking for tools to check my work, I came across a [really useful chrome extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/spectrum/ofclemegkcmilinpcimpjkfhjfgmhieb/related?hl=en) which simulates different types of colourblindness. In the case of the project I'm working on, I have a slightly tricky problem as the source data is specifically categorized into "Red", "Amber" and "Green" traffic-light-style statuses, so I'll have to think of a way of differentiating the representation of each visually while maintaining the colours. I like [Trello's approach](http://blog.trello.com/you-can-copy-boards-now-finally/) to this, using subtle hatching to differentiate between colours which appear similar. In addition, via a comment on their site, I came across this emerging [attempt to standardize a symbolic represenation of colour](http://coloradd.net/index.asp). I'm not sure how widely used or understood it is, but might be a useful thing to investigate.

# Otherwise...

... I've been working on some experiments in text classification, which have lead me down a couple of interesting side alleys into some basic linear algebra revision, learning about the difference between different optimization algorithms, and experimenting with using Theano to do numeric computation on the GPU. I'll write more about that next week.
