title: Notes: 14th - 16th July
---

I've had a slightly sporadic working pattern over the last couple of days, hence the combined day notes below. Here's what I've been up to:

## Frameworkless JS and object-oriented design for d3 data visualisations
I'm currently working on a data visualisation project for the cabinet office, and used this project to get to grips with doing javascript in a principled OO manner, as well as with the tooling and ecosystem around modern javascript. I've been loosely following Rob Ashton's ['Look ma no frameworks'][1] method (ntlk has also followed a similar path on their [startup game][2], and [the code][3] is a brilliantly clear example of this sort of approach), depending on small single-purpose libraries where necessary, and using browserify both to include external dependencies and structure my own code neatly into modules.

This wasn't always my preferred approach - I've argued in the past that data visualisation is an analytical task whose output is understanding first and foremost, rather than a product development task whose output is software, and that therefore testing, refactoring, and general good software design is less important in that context. However, having approached this project with more engineering rigour, I've found that it's been paying off a huge amount, and for precisely the reasons I'd argued for not doing so previously. The process of analysis and discovery in data vis is inherently iterative, and involves rapid protyping and testing of visualisations with clients and audience. Having a well-organized, modular set of re-usable software components aids this process rather than hindering it.

One concern so far about my approach is that serious javascript people I know seem to really hate Browserify. I need to learn more about their criticisms and look into alternatives. ES6 apparently will have a built-in module system, so that sounds ideal once support for it is widespread.

## Exploring spurious 'data' journalism with python
I spent some time yesterday digging into a [rather specious set of claims][4] on a newspaper article about the Retail sales index figures. I'm in the process of writing this up thoroughly, but in the meantime, I'm still awed that the amazing python data analysis toolchain, coupled with the power of open data, make fact-checking newspaper stats reporting [the work of 15 minutes][5].

## Music and a sense of place
There was a [really interesting programme[6] on radio 4 the other day, in which two musicians (Courtney Pine and Anna Meredith) wrote and performed musical interpretations of the London skyline. As well as including some wonderful music, it was a wonderful exposition of the many ways in which a sense of place can influence creativity. As a result, I'm now full of ideas about interesting things I could do with the data about [people's movements in Derby][7] that I worked on with Polkaspots.
