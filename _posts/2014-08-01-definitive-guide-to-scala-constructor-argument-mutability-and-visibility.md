title: A final, definitive record of the mutability and visibility properties of scala constructor arguments, produced for the preservation of my own sanity
---

Case class - public val by default
class - scoped var like a method arg by default.

use val or var (public by default)

private keyword to make private (check actual visibility properties of this)
