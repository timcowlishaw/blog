##Clicking, touching, affordances.

I started the week finishing off a few loose ends on one of my data
visualisation projects. x

Defn and Conventions, UI language, metaphor, leading to conceptual model. Don Norman [01] and [02]
Fingerprints, a sort of faked 'desire line' [03]
Do we even need it? [04]

Thoughts - trend for instructional animations / modal thingies are both
obstructive (for those who know what they're doing) and useless for those who
don't as they're ephemeral.

Should stay around until someone's used it.

Good old text where results of action should be.

Other concerns. Hover / click. Ephemeral actions. Trade-off between cluttered UI
and single elements with too many roles / actions. - back to affordances again.
How do we advertise all the ways of interacting with a UI element?

Responsive / mobile first is hard, and not just about screen sizes!
