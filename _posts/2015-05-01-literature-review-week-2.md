## Understanding User Productivity - M Picq 2014

This is a Masters thesis supervised by Emine and Filip from last year, describing a project to measure the effect of time-tracking tools on a users productivity. It provides a useful overview of the literature on tracking and analysing computer usage, and an outline of the process and technical challenges of writing a time-tracking application for Windows, as well as the analysis of user behaviour itself.
One drawback of the experiment (which is highlighted within the paper's own analysis) is the fact that productivity is inherently subjective. While the paper reports a statistically significant ($ p \\leq 0.01 $) increase in user productivity, partitioning the users into those using their computers for professional purposes, and those using them in a personal capacity, indicates that the effect is only significant for the 'professional' users, possibly indicating that the dependent variable in the experiment (a boolean 'productive' vs. 'not productive' judgement per application or site provided by the experimentor) encodes a particular set of assumptions about what constitutes 'productive' behaviour which are biased towards specific processional situations. This could be investigated further (as the report acknowledges) by allowing users to define for themselves which activities are considered productive or not. This only requires a slight relaxation of the assumptions of the experiment: rather than assuming that the classification of an activity as being productive or not-productive is constat globally, we have to assume that it is constant with respect to time for each user. (Of course, this is still a simplifying assumption, but a weaker one than the original study makes). There is also the possibility of some interaction with the results from the reflective behaviour of classifying ones own behaviours, but this could be a useful line of enquiry in its own right - 'reflection' being one of [Whitakker and Sellen]('http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=130843')'s  'Five Rs' of lifelogging user behaviour).

A diary study which set out to update existing taxonomies of web activities in order to better reflect the ways in which use of the web is intertwined with everyday life and situated within it. Using a grounded theory analysis of the diaries and interviews with the study participants, the paper instead proposes a new taxonomy of 5 "modes" of internet use, which cut across domain, media type and application: ("Respite", "Orienting, "Opportunistic Use", "Purposeful use" and "Lean-back Internet") as well as highlighting two material qualities of the web which enable these modes of use. This could present an interesting opportunity for understanding a more subjective notion of productivity as discussed above - it might be interesting to measure how these 5 modes correlate with self-reported productivity, whether mode can be inferred from user interaction, and whether reporting time spent in each mode of interaction (in a manner analagous to  Picq 2014) produces any improvement in self-reported productivity.

## [Cross-Device Search](http://research.microsoft.com/en-us/um/people/ryenw/talks/pdf/MontanezCIKM2014.pdf) (Monta√±ez, White and Huang, 2014)

Study based on commercial search engine logs investigating how and when users transition between two devices between successive queries. Demonstrates a predictive model both for the probability that a device transition occurs, and the probablity of the next device type conditioned on a transition having occured. (The unconditioned probabillity of the next device is less interesting as it is dominated by the large prior probability that no switch occured, hence the 'previous device' feature dominates and the most likely next device is always the previous one). Interesting findings: the topic of the previous query and the overall probability of a transition conditioned on the current device are good predictors for the probability of a transition occuring, however they do not predict the next device well (which is overwhelmingly predicted by the user-specific device transition probability - possibly because the overwhelming majority of users in the study who used more than one device used two). Suggests opportunities for further work including a qualatitive study investigating the reasons for device transitions and the physical way in which they happen, and a similar quantitative study investigating device transitions between search sessions, rather than individual queries.

A novel algorithm for detecting activity switches on desktop computers, along with empirical analysis via a user study. Works by grouping all pairs of individual actions where the time between them is less than to the weekly average for that user and application. This approach is justified by empirical evidence gathered from activity logs. Results show an improvement over prior work and baseline in empirical study, but the significance of this is not reported.
