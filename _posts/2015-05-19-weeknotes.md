(I've decided to write more general weeknotes, rather than concentrating
specifically on my PhD studies here - Although it's obviously what I'm spending
the vast majority of my time on, it seems silly to limit the scope of what
I write about.)

Two weeks worth here, as I was a little waylaid by the general election the week
before last!

## PhD

I've been continuing my literature review over the last couple of weeks, and in
particular, started looking at the literature related to
[*Refinding*](http://eprints.cs.vt.edu/archive/00000715/01/RefindingIsNotFinding-final.pdf).
As well as being an interesting area in it's own right, it seems like refinding
tasks are a natural application for some the passive activity tracking
/ contextual suggestion (I'm still struggling to find the right terminology here
slightly) techniques I'm studying, for two significant reasons. Firstly, the
problem of *post-value recall* is central to the task of refinding (Essentially,
the value of a piece of information might reveal itself a long time after it was
first retrieved, leading to the need to *refind* the information) and therefore
some form of passive capture of information would be a natural strategy for
alleviating this. Secondly, episodic memory (our memory of our own actions)
plays an important role in recall - We'll often recall what we were doing when
we encountered a particular bit of information, and other details of the context
- this also suggests to me that the use of automatically captured contextual
information could be useful here. Both of these factors point to the fact that
the technology and techniques I'm researching could be used to augment human
memory in a refinding context, rather than simply replacing it - a factor
identified by [Sellen and
Whittaker](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=130843) as
being important to the design of successful lifelogging applications.

I've also spent some time this week attempting to read through some basic
cognitive psychology literature on memory in order to better understand this.
It's a little outside my usual comfort-zone but has proved to be productive.
There's an excellent book on the shelf in my office which I've been reading
called [Engineering Psychology and Human
Performance](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1051291.Engineering_Psychology_and_Human_Performance)
which has helped massively as a way into this.

This week, as advised by Emine, I'm going to dig into the literature on search
personalisation, and on mobile search and cross-device search behaviour. Next
week I'll be looking into organizing a preliminary study into activity tracking -
possibly alongside Manisha and/or Jian who are both working on similar projects.

## Other things

I'm playing around with setting up a [tilde.club](http://tilde.club) clone for
people in Walthamstow, called [e17.club](http://e17.club). It's still in it's
early stages (I've got to write up some introductory tutorials and so on), but
I'm hoping it'll become a fun and useful people for people locally who want to
learn about technology or simply just use it to be creative online.

Vicky and I had a really interesting day out on Saturday - to [Trinity Buoy
Wharf](http://www.trinitybuoywharf.com/), home of the
[Longplayer](http://www.trinitybuoywharf.com/) installation, as well as various
other interesting bits of sculpture. Longplayer is a wonderful project - a one-thousand
year long musical composition playing 24 hours a day in the lighthouse at the wharf,
as well as in multiple locations around the world, and on the web. As happens
often after listening to really interesting music and sound art, as we left the
lighthouse, my ears were more attuned than usual to the sounds of everyday life,
and as we cycled back past [Telecity](http://www.telecitygroup.com/), I was
struck by how the roar of the air-conditioning was almost part and parcel of the
longplayer composition itself - being made by the very machines 'performing' it,
in some sense.

Oh, finally, I [ran a half marathon](https://instagram.com/p/2f-24XhBop/) last weekend, in two hours 12 minutes,
which I'm pretty pleased with!
