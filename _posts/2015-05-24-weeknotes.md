## PhD

Most of my reading this week has been on search behaviour on mobile devices.
While it's currently looking unlikely that my work in the near future will
concentrate on mobile devices specifically, this has still been valuable, both
in terms of giving me an overview of the field for future research, and more
generally improving my understanding of HCI concerns related to search and
information retrieval. I'm now starting to get a feel for unexplored areas in
the literature where I could perhaps make a useful contribution, and have begun
to try and flesh these out into more concrete proposals.

Given, whatever specific direction my research takes me in, it's likely to
involve passive activity tracking on a user's desktop computer, I've also begun
to look into the specifics of implementing this. Since it's likely that most
participants in my study will be using Windows (both due to market share, and
the fact that my supervisors both work at Microsoft Research), this has involved
delving into the [Windows Accessibility APIs](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/ee663255(v=vs.85).aspx),
which should allow me to capture information about user activity. I've also been
[learning F#](http://www.tryfsharp.org), since this seems to me to be the most
interesting language available for the platform, and I've been interested in
trying it out for a while. Getting a windows development environment set up on
my Mac was also pretty simple - [this guide](http://www.hurryupandwait.io/blog/in-search-of-a-light-weight-windows-vagrant-box)
to setting up a Windows VM which is runnable with vagrant was invaluable - I
simply added the step of installing Visual Studio on it. This way I can edit my
code in Vim on my mac, as I would usually, with Visual Studio building it inside
the VM.

A couple of other bits and pieces:

I got hold of a British Library readers pass on Wednesday and spent an
afternoon working down there, which was a nice change of scenery.

I invited the rest of my group to a [Slack](http://slack.com) chat, since we're
not always in the same place (at least two of us are out on internships and once
is part time), and often have useful ideas, references and links to share.
Hopefully this will turn out to be useful.

This coming week, I'm going to work on writing up the potential research
opportunities I've identified in the literature, for discussion with Emine and
Filip, which will hopefully allow us to identify a specific research question,
and begin making a plan for how to proceed. I'm also going to catch up on some
of my BRML reading, as I've neglected that slightly over the last week or two.
