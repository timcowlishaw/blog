### [Understanding Mobile Web and Mobile Search Use in Today's Dynamic Mobile
Landscape](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=203738) (Church and Oliver 2011)

Diary and interview study focusing on ways in which people use the mobile web
and mobile search, as well as their motivations for doing so. The study builds
upon previous work suggesting that an increasing share of mobile internet use
happens in non-mobile settings. The study aims to focus on the context of mobile
internet use, identifying that this context is made up of three principal
facets: location, social context and temporal context. Some key findings:

* Over 70% of reported mobile internet use was recorded in familiar, stationary
  surroundings, such as at home or work.
* The mobile web was used extensively in social contexts, as a form of social
  facilitation. The majority of mobile search queries take place in social
  contexts.
* In addition, use of mobile search tends to occur in more frequently in unfamiliar
  surroundings, and with greater urgency than general mobile web use.
* The urgency of mobile web tasks was consistently higher in mobile settings
  compared to familiar or stationary ones.

This paper sites a great deal of previous work on mobile search and internet
usage. Some of the most pertient references:

* [Understanding the intent behind mobile information needs](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1502686) (Church and Smyth 2009) presents a diary study of all information needs, both at home, at work or
  mobile. This might present some useful context for research into transitions
between devices and cross-device search.

* These two papers also explore the motivations behind mobile web use and propose
  a taxonomy of key motivators:
    * [A framework for understanding mobile internet motivations and behaviors](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1358744) (Taylor, Anicello, Somohano, Samuels, Whitaker and Ramey 2008)
    * [Always on: A framework for understanding personal web motivations, behaviors
and contexts of use](http://www.igi-global.com/article/always-framework-understanding-personal-mobile/37459) (Taylor, Samuels and Ramey 2009)

### [Understanding the importance of location, time and people in mobile local
search behaviour](http://research.microsoft.com/apps/pubs/default.aspx?id=153023) (Teevan, Karlson, Amini, Brush and Krumm 2011)

Survey on mobile search use by Microsoft employees. It specifically enquires about
'local search' on mobile devices - searches for places with a regionalised
geographic location. The paper takes the relevance of 'location' to mobile
search as a given, which is challenged by the finidngs in Church and Oliver,
above). Key findings:

* The location being searched for was proximate to the subject in only 40% of
  cases.

* 68% of subjects were in transit when the search was performedl

* 27% of subjects wanted information about their destination, 12% wanted
  information about places close to their destination, and 12% about places
en route to their destination.

* 47% of searches were for specific locations, 49% were searching for places
  that met some more general criteria.

### [Upright or sideways? Analysis of Smartphone Postures in the Wild](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2493230) (Shirazi, Henze, Dingler, Schmidt and Kunze, 2003)

Study into smartphone posture and device movement, carried out on data
from 1330 users of an Android application. This is an interesting, and to some
extent novel approach to research data gathering - the researchers created an
android application which was useful in its own right - (a dashboard widget giving easy access to a user's most frequent applications), but which also collected the research data needed, and made it available on the Google Play store. As well as the discussion of their own study and findings, this paper includes some discussion of the pragmatics and ethical concerns related to this method of data acquisition, as will as referencing previous similar work. Key findings of the study:

* Phones are moved more when navigation and messaging applications are in use.
  In contrast, less motion is observed during the use of web browsers than other
applications.

* Most apps are used in portrait mode the majority of the time (although users
  often briefly rotate the phone into landscape mode for text entry). Media
applications, however, are predominantly used in landscape mode.

from a case study with lifelogs](http://doras.dcu.ie/20388/) (Chen and Jones
2014)

### [Real-time task recognition based on knowledge workers' computer
activities](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=2448170) (Koldijk, van Staalduinen, Neerincx and Kraaij 2012)

Field study testing the use of an automatic tool for classifying computer
interaction data into tasks. Shows good classification accuracy on
a comparitively small amount of training data, and highlights a number of other
useful insights:
* workers tend to classify activities in terms of purpose or intent, rather than
  by application, or type of activity.
* while classification accuracy within individual users activities was good,
  a classifier trained on one user did not generalise well to other users. This
indicates that individual activities are highly specific and a level of
personalisation is needed.

In addition, includes some useful background on practicalities of task
classification, both in terms of feature engineering and user experience.

### [Task behaviours during web search: The difficulty of assigning labels](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpls/abs_all.jsp?arnumber=4755491&tag=1)
(Russell, Tang, Kellar and Jeffries 2009)

Study investigating labelling of queries with search task information - finding
that activity labelled by the searcher themselves is far more accurate than
activity labelled by a third-party.
