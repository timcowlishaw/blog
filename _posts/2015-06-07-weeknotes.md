### PhD ###
My efforts to organize my workload a bit better last week have gone, broadly
speaking very well, however, I've not had as much time to dedicate to my work as
I'd like this week as, along with the rest of my group, I've been spending much
of my time marking [Information Retrieval](http://www.cs.ucl.ac.uk/students/syllabus/mscml/gi15_information_retrieval_data_mining/) exam papers. This was an eye-opening exercise: both in terms of revising some basics of the subject with which I was a little rusty, and in terms of seeing first hand how others approach exams, and how they are marked.

In addition, I also wasted a little bit of time at the beginning of the week due
to the fact that my Mendeley database managed to corrupt itself, losing a lot of
the organization I'd done of my research paper library. This seemed
like a good excuse to ditch Mendeley entirely (I've wanted to move away from
using it since I realised they were owned by Elsevier, who [are shits](https://gowers.wordpress.com/2012/01/21/elsevier-my-part-in-its-downfall/).) Thankfully, the open-source [Zotero](https://www.zotero.org/) does everything I need (along with the [Zotfile](http://zotfile.com/) plugin) and so far is easier to use than Mendeley. It was also pretty painless to transfer my library across (With the exception of the folder structure I'd created, but this only took an hour or so of dragging and dropping in front of the TV one evening to recreate), and crucially, it offers a solution to the problem I described last week of keeping track of relationships between papers, as it allows you to 'link' related publications.

However, I did also found the time to [review some of the
literature](http://blog.timcowlishaw.co.uk/2015/06/05/literature-review_part-3/)
on task identification, as well as beginning my research plan for the next few
months. In advance of doin g this, I also did some revision from my [research
methods textbook](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/5631708-research-methods-for-human-computer-interaction), which was a useful refresher - it helped me to think more formally about the hypothesis I was testing, the dependent and independent variables, likely confounds that I would have to eliminate or control for, and possible approaches to analysiing the results. The whole process of writing this plan is helping me focus my thoughts in fact - by setting out my proposal as a series of concrete, testable hypotheses, I feel I've got a much clearer understanding of what I'm trying to achieve, and am much more able to articulate it.

I also met [Marios](https://uk.linkedin.com/pub/marios-mintzis/a6/6b0/968), this week, he's a masters student who's going to be working with us on an activity tracking project related to my own.

### Elsewhere ###

I also [quickly rustled up](http://nominate-jeremy.appspot.com/mp/write) a [write-to-mp](https://github.com/robinhouston/write-to-mp) derivative to assist in the process of soliciting nominations for [Jeremy Corbyn's campaign for the Labour leadership](http://jeremyforlabour.com/). We've had 760 emails sent out in 5 days through the site, which I think is pretty respectable.

On Saturday Vicky and I took a wander around the [E17 Art
Trail](http://www.e17arttrail.co.uk/) - a great local initiative consisting of
two weeks of exhibitions, events and open studios around Walthamstow. We hardly
scratched the surface of everything on offer, but saw some fantastic work - in
particular [Owen Booth](https://twitter.com/owenbooth) and [David
Southwell](https://twitter.com/cultauthor)'s [Stories from the
Forest](http://www.e17arttrail.co.uk/index.php?page=101&passed_index=195) is
a brilliant, erie psychogeographic exploration of Epping Forest, and [Gavin
Coyle](http://gavincoyle.co.uk/) makes some wonderfully beautiful and inspired
furniture, and also gave us a really warm welcome to his workshop.

On Wednesday evening, we went to see [The Chap](http://thechap.org) at The
Lexington, who were as archly witty, [fun and interesting](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5mbdwRrZl-Y) as ever.

### Listening ###

Had a listen to the new [FFS](https://open.spotify.com/artist/0OnPrsDBROxkpC3qbFnL6L) tracks, enjoyed them greatly,  and subsequently overdosed on older [Sparks](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7pwjGKaqnfkvS7eQbHaqyH) records.
