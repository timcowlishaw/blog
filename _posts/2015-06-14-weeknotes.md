This week, I started work on the task logging software that's going to be the
apparatus for the first proper study of my research project. It's a little bit
of Windows software (for ease of recruiting participants in the study,
primarily),  I'm writing it in F#, and so far, it's been an incredibly pleasant
experience. F# is a great language, and the Visual Studio tooling is also very
pleasant to use. I was particularly impressed with the ease of calling out to
low level C APIs from within F# - it's as easy as writing a type signature for
the foreign function, and annotating it with the location of the .dll file with
its definition. I'm doing the majority of this work directly in Visual Studio
inside a VM (with [VsVim](https://visualstudiogallery.msdn.microsoft.com/59ca71b3-a4a3-46ca-8fe1-0e90e3f79329) without which I think I might have found the whole experience frustrating). However, I'd like to somehow set up VS to watch the filesystem for changes and build automatically on the VM, so that I can edit files and do the rest of my work natively on my machine. I still haven't worked out how to do this though.

I had a productive weekly review with Emine, in which we looked over the draft
research proposal I'm preparing. My direction looks broadly positive, but she
advised me to start with a 'big picture' research question for the whole of my
PhD and then drill down into specific experiments, rather than beginning with
specifics and generalising out; my research proposal outlines a series of specific experiments, and while I think I've got a good idea of the direction they're heading in, I've not been great at articulating it. This'll be my first priority in the coming week.

Emine also alerted me that afternoon to a guest lecture by Abigail Sellen, whose work has featured prominently in my research so far. This was really interesting, and also very useful in helping me articulate my more general research ideas. I've written up a [more complete set of notes on the lecture](http://blog.timcowlishaw.co.uk/2015/06/11/designing-computer-systems-that-see/).

Jiyin and I had a further chat about organising a joint study, and I started
writing up our application to the Ethics Committee - my first taste of
University bureaucracy since my application, and definitely not the last!

Outside of work, I returned to [Grasmere
school](http://www.grasmere.hackney.sch.uk/) to cover the [code
club](https://www.codeclub.org.uk/) I used to run while
[Frank](https://twitter.com/fth_nix), my replacement, had a week of. It was
a really fun hour that  went all too quickly. It was great to see all the kids
and see how they'd progressed - Frank's done some astonishing work with them in
my absence. I also caught up over a beer or two with
[Sam](http://twitter.com/samphippen) and [Bestie](http://twitter.com/thebestie),
with whom I used to work at Cambridge Healthcare, and finished the week with
a couple of days in Derbyshire with Vicky and my parents - visiting family, running
around [Calke Park](http://www.nationaltrust.org.uk/calke-abbey/) and visiting the [National brewery centre](http://www.nationalbrewerycentre.co.uk/).
